#  Movie Review App (ASP.NET MVC  Project)

This is a simple **Movie Review App** built using **ASP.NET MVC**, showcasing basic **CRUD operations**, **Authentication/Role-Based Authorization**, clean code architecture using the **Repository Pattern**, **Entity Framework Core** for database management, and **Cloudinary** integration for image storage. 
It's also **test-driven**, with unit tests written using **xUnit**, **FluentAssertions** for expressive assertions, and **FakeItEasy** to mock controller logic and services. These tests check behaviors like  helping ensure controller logic behaves correctly in different scenarios. 

In this app, Users can create their own movies, upload movie images to the cloud, leave comments on other movies, edit their own profiles, and view other users along with the movies they've created. **Admins** have full control and can edit or delete any movie, while **Regular Users** can only modify their own.
